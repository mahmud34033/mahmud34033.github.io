Alongside my research, I have strong programming skills with proficiency in C, C++, Python, Java, and SQL. I have been an active competitive programmer, solving over 2,000 problems across online judges such as Codeforces, CodeChef, and AtCoder. I have also participated in several national and divisional onsite programming contests, including ICPC regionals and IUPC. Through my academic projects, research, and extracurricular activities, I have developed strong communication, teamwork, and planning skills, enabling me to collaborate effectively in both research and software development settings.
